# Texture coordinates & UV basics

<p>Texture coordinates, often referred to as UV coordinates, are a fundamental concept in computer graphics and game development. They define how textures are mapped onto 3D surfaces, allowing artists to apply detailed and intricate textures to objects in a visually accurate and controlled manner.</p>
<p>UV coordinates represent a 2D coordinate system that corresponds to points on the surface of a 3D model. These coordinates are typically expressed as values between 0 and 1, with (0,0) representing the bottom-left corner of the texture and (1,1) representing the top-right corner. UV coordinates are used to sample specific pixels from a texture and map them onto the corresponding vertices or polygons of a 3D model.</p>
<p>UV mapping is the process of assigning UV coordinates to the vertices of a 3D model. It involves unwrapping the model's surface onto a 2D plane, allowing the artist to visualize and paint textures onto the flattened representation. The UV unwrapping process determines how the surface of the 3D model is divided and flattened, impacting the distortion and quality of the final textured result.</p>
<p>UV coordinates are essential for a variety of texture mapping techniques, including:</p>
<p>1. Diffuse Textures: These textures represent the base color or appearance of an object's surface. By mapping UV coordinates to the diffuse texture, artists can apply intricate patterns, images, or colors onto the 3D model, adding detail and realism.</p>
<p>2. Normal Maps: Normal maps simulate the fine details of a surface by using RGB values to encode surface normals. By applying UV coordinates to normal maps, artists can enhance the visual appearance of the 3D model, adding the illusion of depth and surface details without increasing the polygon count.</p>
<p>3. Specular and Gloss Maps: Specular and gloss maps control the shininess and reflectivity of a material. By assigning UV coordinates to these maps, artists can precisely control the reflective properties of different areas on the 3D model's surface, creating varied and realistic material effects.</p>
<p>UV coordinates are also essential for texture tiling and repetition. By carefully aligning and scaling the UV coordinates, artists can control how textures repeat across a surface, ensuring seamless and visually appealing texture patterns.</p>
<p>In summary, UV coordinates or texture coordinates provide the mapping between 3D objects and 2D textures, allowing artists to apply detailed and accurate textures onto 3D models. By assigning UV coordinates to vertices, artists can control how textures are applied, enabling the creation of visually stunning and detailed 3D assets in computer graphics and game development.</p>
