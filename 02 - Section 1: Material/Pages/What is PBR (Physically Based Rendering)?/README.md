# What is PBR (Physically Based Rendering)?

<p>Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is a rendering technique used in computer graphics that aims to accurately simulate the interaction of light with materials in a physically realistic manner. PBR is based on the principles of physics and optics, allowing digital representations of materials to closely resemble their real-world counterparts.</p>
<p>Traditionally, in computer graphics, materials were created using ad-hoc models and artistic approximations. However, PBR introduces a more systematic approach by utilizing measurable physical properties of materials, such as reflectivity, roughness, and transparency, to achieve more accurate and consistent results.</p>
<p>The key idea behind PBR is to simulate the behavior of light as it interacts with materials based on their physical properties. This includes how light is reflected, refracted, and scattered by different materials. By accurately representing these characteristics, PBR allows for the creation of materials that exhibit a high level of realism and respond believably to lighting conditions.</p>
<p>In PBR, materials are typically defined using a set of texture maps. These maps include the albedo or base color map, which represents the surface color of the material, the roughness map, which controls the level of surface roughness or smoothness, the metalness or reflectivity map, which determines if the material is metallic or dielectric, and other maps like the normal map and ambient occlusion map, which add additional surface details and shading information.</p>
<p>To render materials using PBR, the lighting and shading calculations take into account the physical properties defined by these texture maps. The lighting model used in PBR is typically based on the energy conservation principle, ensuring that the total amount of light reflected by a surface does not exceed the amount of light it receives. This helps create more accurate and believable lighting results.</p>
<p>PBR has become increasingly popular in the game development and visual effects industries due to its ability to achieve highly realistic and consistent rendering results. It provides a standardized and physically accurate framework for creating materials, allowing artists and developers to achieve visually compelling results across different lighting conditions and environments.</p>
<p>By simulating the behavior of light in a physically accurate way, PBR brings a new level of visual fidelity and realism to computer-generated images, making them more indistinguishable from real-world materials and enhancing the overall immersion in virtual environments.</p>
