# Introduction to master materials and material instances

<p>Introduction to Master Materials and Material Instances</p>
<p>In Unreal Engine, Master Materials and Material Instances are powerful tools that streamline the creation, customization, and management of materials. They provide a flexible and efficient workflow for artists and developers to create visually rich and varied materials while maintaining consistency and optimizing performance.</p>
<p>Master Materials:<br>A Master Material, also known as a parent material, is a highly versatile material created as a base template for a specific material type or category. It contains a collection of nodes and parameters that define the material's appearance and behavior. Master Materials serve as the foundation for creating variations of materials with different properties, such as color, texture inputs, and material functions.</p>
<p>By utilizing a Master Material, artists can establish a consistent set of parameters and visual characteristics across multiple instances of materials. They can define a wide range of properties and effects within the Master Material, allowing for flexibility and reusability. This approach simplifies material creation and updates, as modifications made to the Master Material automatically propagate to all its instances, ensuring consistency throughout the project.</p>
<p>Material Instances:<br>A Material Instance is a derived copy of a Master Material that inherits its properties and characteristics. Material Instances allow artists and designers to customize and tweak specific parameters of a material without modifying the original Master Material. This enables efficient iteration and customization of materials while maintaining a connection to the Master Material's underlying framework.</p>
<p>Material Instances offer a high level of flexibility by exposing selected parameters of the Master Material as editable attributes. These parameters can include color values, textures, scalar values, and more. By adjusting these parameters within the Material Instance, artists can create variations of the material with unique visual properties, such as different colors, patterns, or levels of roughness.</p>
<p>One of the significant advantages of Material Instances is their efficiency. Since Material Instances only store the modified parameters and reference the Master Material for the unchanged elements, they have a smaller memory footprint and can significantly optimize rendering performance. Additionally, artists can create multiple Material Instances based on a single Master Material, allowing for efficient asset management and reducing replication of materials in the project.</p>
<p>The combination of Master Materials and Material Instances provides a robust and flexible workflow for material creation and customization in Unreal Engine. By utilizing a Master Material as a foundation and creating Material Instances to tailor specific variations, artists can achieve visual consistency, optimize performance, and efficiently manage materials across a project. This approach empowers artists and developers to create diverse and visually compelling materials while maintaining an organized and streamlined workflow.</p>
